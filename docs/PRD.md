## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORKFLOW INTEGRATION (READ FIRST!)

**This PRD template is designed to work with the Claude Dev Workflow v3.1+**

### Before You Start

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] Read [claude.md - MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS](../claude.md#‚ö†Ô∏è-mandatory-requirements-read-first) section
- [ ] Understand multi-agent deployment criteria (3+ features = deploy team)
- [ ] Know platform-specific mandatory tech standards (if iOS: SwiftUI, SwiftData, @Observable only)
- [ ] Understand quality gates (precommit, phase gates, screenshot evidence)

### How This PRD Integrates with Workflow

**Phase 0: PRD Creation**
1. ‚úÖ Fill out this entire template
2. ‚úÖ Get stakeholder approval
3. ‚úÖ Use completed PRD with zen `planner` tool:
   ```yaml
   Tool: zen:planner
   model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
   step: "Break down [Project Name] PRD into detailed phase plan with dependencies"
   # Attach: This completed PRD
   ```

**During Development**
- **Major Technical Decisions**: Create ADRs (see [ADR Guide](./adr/README.md))
  - Use tool chain: `challenge` ‚Üí `consensus` ‚Üí (optional) `clink` ‚Üí ADR
- **Critical Scenarios**: Use `clink` for external AI perspectives
  - Security reviews, complex bugs, high-stakes decisions
- **Phase Completions**: Run mandatory phase gates
  - `analyze` (quality) ‚Üí `refactor` (debt) ‚Üí `analyze` (performance)

**Quality Requirements**
- ‚úÖ Every commit requires zen `precommit` tool (MANDATORY)
- ‚úÖ Every feature requires screenshot evidence
- ‚úÖ Every phase requires phase gate validation
- ‚úÖ Build + tests must pass before completion

**Multi-Agent Teams**
- If 3+ features in P1/P2: **MUST deploy multi-agent team** (see [Agent Deployment](./agent-deployment.md))
- Coordinator ensures all agents follow this PRD

### Zen Tools Quick Reference for PRD Workflow

**Phase 0 - Planning**:
- `planner`: Break down completed PRD into detailed project plan
- `thinkdeep`: Architecture decisions (save continuation_id)
- `challenge`: Question technical assumptions before committing
- `consensus`: Multi-model analysis for major decisions
- `clink`: (Optional) External AI perspective for critical decisions

**During Development**:
- `chat`: Day-to-day assistance and questions
- `apilookup`: Latest API documentation
- `debug`: Issue resolution when problems arise
- `codereview`: Quality checks before task completion
- `precommit`: **MANDATORY** before EVERY commit

**Phase Completion**:
- `analyze` (quality): Establish quality baseline
- `refactor` (debt): Identify technical debt
- `analyze` (performance): Measure performance metrics

**See**: [Zen Tools Guide](./zen-tools-guide.md) | [Tool Chaining Patterns](./tool-chaining-patterns.md)

**Instructions for Use**:

**Phase 0 - PRD Creation**:
1. ‚úÖ Read [claude.md - MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS](../claude.md#‚ö†Ô∏è-mandatory-requirements-read-first) first
2. ‚úÖ Copy this template for your project
3. ‚úÖ Fill in ALL sections completely
4. ‚úÖ For iOS: Verify tech stack follows [iOS Development Standards](./ios-development.md)
5. ‚úÖ Review with team and stakeholders
6. ‚úÖ Get formal approval (sign-off section)

**Phase 0 - Project Planning**:
7. ‚úÖ Use zen `planner` with completed PRD:
   ```yaml
   Tool: zen:planner
   model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
   step: "Break down [Project Name] PRD into detailed phase plan with task dependencies"
   working_directory: "/absolute/path/to/project"
   # Reference this completed PRD in your prompt
   ```
8. ‚úÖ Deploy multi-agent team if 3+ features (see [Agent Deployment](./agent-deployment.md))
9. ‚úÖ Create ADRs for any major technical decisions using tool chain:
   - `challenge` ‚Üí `consensus` ‚Üí (optional) `clink` ‚Üí Create ADR
   - See [Tool Chaining Patterns](./tool-chaining-patterns.md) Pattern 10

**During Development**:
10. ‚úÖ Reference PRD throughout development
11. ‚úÖ Update as requirements evolve (version control)
12. ‚úÖ Create ADRs for new major decisions
13. ‚úÖ Run zen `precommit` before EVERY commit (MANDATORY)
14. ‚úÖ Capture screenshot evidence for every feature
15. ‚úÖ Run mandatory phase gates at end of each phase

**Quality Checklist (Every Phase)**:
- [ ] zen `precommit` passed for all commits
- [ ] Screenshot evidence for all features
- [ ] Tests ‚â•70% coverage
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Phase gates passed (analyze + refactor + analyze)

**Remember**:
- A well-defined PRD enables effective planning with zen `planner`
- Following mandatory requirements prevents rework and failed quality gates
- Multi-agent teams are REQUIRED for projects with 3+ features
- Phase gates are MANDATORY - no exceptions!
