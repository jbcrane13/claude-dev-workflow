## Core Principles

### 1. **Comprehensive State Documentation**
Every session must document:
- What was done
- Why decisions were made
- What's next
- Current blockers
- Project context

### 2. **Continuation ID Usage**
- Use Zen `chat` with `continuation_id` parameter
- Maintains conversation history
- Preserves context across sessions
- Enables seamless resumption

### 3. **Explicit Handoff Protocol**
- Clear transfer of responsibility
- Comprehensive context provided
- No assumptions about prior knowledge
- Verification of understanding

### 4. **State Persistence**
- Session state files in `tracking/`
- Git commits with descriptive messages
- Documentation updates
- Screenshot archives

### 5. **Recovery Mechanisms**
- Every session can be reconstructed
- Multiple sources of truth
- Clear escalation paths
- Human intervention when needed

Next agent should:
1. Complete unit tests (mostly done)
2. Run build verification
3. Do final code review
4. Mark Phase 1 complete
5. Begin Phase 2 planning

**Zen Continuation ID**: [Store continuation_id here if using Zen chat]

---

## Emergency Recovery Info

**Project Root**: /path/to/project
**Git Branch**: main
**Last Commit**: abc123 "Complete task CRUD operations"
**Build Last Successful**: 2025-01-20 15:30
**Tests Last Passed**: 2025-01-20 15:00
```

---

## Starting a Session

### Step 1: Load Context

**Coordinator Agent Starts Every Session**:

```
1. Read tracking/session-state.md
2. Read tracking/phase-status.md
3. Review last git commits
4. Check for new issues/blockers
5. Use Zen chat with continuation_id if available
```

**Using Zen Tools**:
```yaml
Tool: zen:chat
Parameters:
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  prompt: "Load project context and provide current status summary"
  continuation_id: "[previous_session_id]"
  files: 
    - "tracking/session-state.md"
    - "tracking/phase-status.md"
  working_directory: "/path/to/project"
```

---

### Step 2: Verify Understanding

**Coordinator Self-Check**:
- ‚úÖ I understand the current phase
- ‚úÖ I know what's complete
- ‚úÖ I know what's in progress
- ‚úÖ I know the blockers
- ‚úÖ I know next steps

**If unclear**: Ask clarifying questions before proceeding

---

### Step 3: Communicate Status

**Post to team**:
```markdown
## Session Start: 2025-01-20 16:00

**Current Status**: Phase 1 at 75% completion
**Active Work**: Unit tests (80% done)
**Next Steps**: Complete tests, build verification
**Blockers**: None
**Expected Completion**: This session

All agents: Review tracking/session-state.md for context.
```

---

### Step 4: Confirm Agent Availability

**Check which agents are active**:
- Coordinator (you) ‚úÖ
- Architecture Agent - available?
- Feature Agent - available?
- UI Agent - available?
- Testing Agent - needed ‚úÖ

**Assign or reassign as needed**

---

## During a Session

### Continuous State Updates

**Update `session-state.md` after**:
- Major decisions (log in Decision Log)
- Task completions
- Blocker discoveries or resolutions

- ‚úÖ `README.md` (if major changes)

---

### Step 3: Commit to Git

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Session end: Phase 1 95% complete - tests and build verified

- Completed unit tests (all passing)
- Verified build on simulator
- Captured all screenshots
- Ready for final code review

Next: Final review and Phase 1 sign-off"
```

---

### Step 4: Save Continuation Context

**For Zen tools**:
```markdown
Continuation ID for next session: cont_abc123xyz

To resume:
Tool: zen:chat
Parameters:
  continuation_id: "cont_abc123xyz"
  prompt: "Resume Phase 1 completion - need final review"
  files: ["tracking/session-state.md"]
```

---

## Agent Handoffs

### Scenario 1: Same Agent, Next Session

**Handoff is to yourself later**:

1. **Update session-state.md comprehensively**
2. **Write clear "Next Steps"**
3. **Save continuation_id**
4. **Commit all changes**

**Next session, you just load and continue**

---

### Scenario 2: Different Agent, Same Role

**Example: Feature Agent A ‚Üí Feature Agent B**

**Agent A Prepares Handoff**:

```markdown
## Handoff to Next Feature Agent

**Context**: Implementing task categories (Phase 2, PROJ-201)

**What I Completed**:
- Created Category model (SwiftData)
- Added relationship to Task
- Updated TaskStore to handle categories

**Current State**:
- Code: 70% complete
- Location: Sources/Models/Category.swift, Sources/Stores/TaskStore.swift
- Tests: Not yet written
- Build: Successful
- Status: Working, but needs category UI integration

**What's Next**:
1. UI Agent needs to create category picker UI
2. Then: Add category assignment to AddTaskView
3. Then: Filter tasks by category in list
4. Then: Write tests

**Blockers**:
None, but waiting on UI Agent for category picker

**Important Notes**:
- Used cascade delete for category relationships
- Category has name, color, and icon properties
- Max 10 categories per user (business rule)

**Files**:
- Sources/Models/Category.swift
- Sources/Models/Task.swift (updated)
- Sources/Stores/TaskStore.swift (updated)

**Continuation ID**: cont_feature_xyz789

**Zen Tools Used**:
- `analyze` for data model design
- `codereview` for relationship verification
```

**Agent B Receives**:
1. Reads handoff notes
2. Loads continuation_id
3. Reviews modified files
4. Asks questions if unclear
5. Acknowledges understanding
6. Continues work

---

### Scenario 3: Agent Role Change

**Example: Feature Agent ‚Üí Testing Agent**

**Feature Agent**:
```markdown
## Handoff to Testing Agent

**Task Complete**: PROJ-205 - Task category assignment

**What Was Built**:
- Users can now assign categories to tasks
- Category picker in AddTaskView
- Filter by category in TaskListView
- All features working

**Testing Needed**:
1. Unit tests for category assignment
2. Unit tests for category filtering
3. Unit tests for edge cases:
   - Task with no category
   - Deleting category with tasks
   - Max category limit
4. Build verification
5. Screenshots of category features

**Test Data Scenarios**:
- Create task with category
- Create task without category
- Change task category
- Delete category (should cascade)
- Filter by category (empty results)
- Filter by category (multiple tasks)

**Expected Results**:
All tests should pass, build clean, features work smoothly

**Quality Gates to Verify**:
See quality-gates.md checklist

**Files to Test**:
- Sources/Models/Category.swift
- Sources/Models/Task.swift
- Sources/Stores/TaskStore.swift
- Sources/Views/AddTaskView.swift
- Sources/Views/TaskListView.swift

**Mock Data**:
None needed - using SwiftData

**Continuation ID**: cont_test_abc456
```

## Context Recovery

### When Context is Lost

**Recovery Steps**:

1. **Check Git History**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20
   git show HEAD
   git diff HEAD~5
   ```

2. **Review Session State Files**
   ```
   cat tracking/session-state.md
   cat tracking/phase-status.md
   ls tracking/session-summaries/
   ```

3. **Review Phase Documentation**
   ```
   Understand current phase goal
   Check what's supposed to be complete
   Identify gaps
   ```

4. **Use Zen `analyze`**
   ```yaml
   Tool: zen:analyze
   Parameters:
     model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
     step: "Analyze project state and identify what was being worked on"
     files: 
       - "tracking/session-state.md"
       - [all source files]
     working_directory: "/path/to/project"
   ```

5. **Rebuild Mental Model**
   - What phase are we in?
   - What's the phase goal?
   - What's complete?
   - What's in progress?
   - What's next?

6. **Verify Understanding**
   - Build the project
   - Run tests
   - Review recent commits
   - Check screenshots

7. **Document Recovery**
   ```markdown
   ## Context Recovery: 2025-01-20

   **Issue**: Continuation ID lost, unclear state
   
   **Recovery Actions**:
   1. Reviewed git history
   2. Read session-state.md
   3. Used Zen `analyze` on codebase
   4. Built project successfully
   5. Ran tests (all passing)
   
   **Current Understanding**:
   Phase 1 at 95%, needs final review
   
   **Confidence**: High
   
   **Next Steps**:
   Proceeding with code review
   ```

---

## Zen Tools for Continuity

### Using `chat` with continuation_id

**Best for**: Maintaining conversation context

```yaml
Tool: zen:chat
Parameters:
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  prompt: "Continue working on task categories feature"
  continuation_id: "cont_previous_session"
  files:
    - "tracking/session-state.md"
  working_directory: "/path/to/project"
```

**Benefits**:
- Preserves full conversation history
- Maintains decision context
- Reduces need for re-explanation

---

### Using `analyze` for State Assessment

**Best for**: Understanding current codebase state

```yaml
Tool: zen:analyze
Parameters:
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  step: "Analyze current implementation status of task categories"
  relevant_files:
    - "Sources/Models/Category.swift"
    - "Sources/Stores/TaskStore.swift"
  findings: "Need to understand what's complete and what's pending"
  next_step_required: true
  working_directory: "/path/to/project"
```

---

### Using `planner` for Next Steps

**Best for**: Planning continuation of work

```yaml
Tool: zen:planner
Parameters:
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  step: "Given current Phase 1 status, plan next steps to completion"
  next_step_required: false
  working_directory: "/path/to/project"
```

- [ ] I am ready to proceed
- [ ] I have clarifying questions: [Yes/No]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cannot find continuation_id

**Solution**:
1. Check tracking/session-state.md
2. Check last session summary
3. Review git commit messages
4. Use Zen `analyze` to rebuild context
5. Proceed without continuation_id (document this)

---

### Problem: Session state contradicts code

**Solution**:
1. Trust the code (source of truth)
2. Build and test to verify actual state
3. Update session-state.md to match reality
4. Document the discrepancy
5. Investigate cause to prevent recurrence

---

### Problem: Unclear what was being worked on

**Solution**:
1. Check git diff
2. Review recent commits
3. Run tests to see what's covered
4. Use Zen `analyze` on modified files
5. Ask human for clarification if needed

---

### Problem: Multiple agents worked simultaneously

**Solution**:
1. Review all session summaries
2. Check for merge conflicts
3. Use git log to understand changes
4. Consolidate session states
5. Update to unified current state

---

## Best Practices

### For All Agents

1. **Update session-state.md frequently**
   - After decisions
   - After completions
   - Before long breaks
   - At session end

2. **Use continuation_ids consistently**
   - Save after every session
   - Reference in next session
   - Document in session summaries

3. **Write clear handoff notes**
   - Assume reader knows nothing
   - Provide complete context
   - List explicit next steps

4. **Verify understanding**
   - Don't assume
   - Ask questions
   - Acknowledge receipt

5. **Document decisions**
   - Why, not just what
   - Alternatives considered
   - Impact assessment

### For Coordinators

1. **Own session state**
   - You are responsible for accuracy
   - You ensure completeness
   - You verify continuity

2. **Start every session with context load**
   - Never skip this step
   - Verify understanding
   - Update team

3. **End every session with summary**
   - Comprehensive
   - Clear next steps
   - Handoff ready

4. **Use Zen tools for orchestration**
   - `planner` for organization
   - `chat` for continuity
   - `consensus` for alignment
