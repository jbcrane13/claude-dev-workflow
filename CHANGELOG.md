## [3.1.0] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- **clink Tool Integration**: Comprehensive documentation for using external AI perspectives
  - Detailed `clink` section in docs/zen-tools-guide.md with usage examples
  - 3 new tool chaining patterns featuring clink integration:
    - Pattern 8: Complex Bug with External Validation
    - Pattern 9: Security-Critical Code Review
    - Pattern 10: Architectural Decision with External Challenge
  - Updated claude.md tool table to show clink's tactical use

### Why v3.1
External AI perspectives provide genuine value for critical scenarios (complex bugs, security reviews, high-stakes decisions) by breaking echo chambers and catching blind spots that internal tools miss. This is a tactical enhancement that doesn't change the core workflow but provides a powerful tool for edge cases.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS** section in claude.md (lines 9-106) - Cannot be missed by agents
- **Decision tree** in agent-deployment.md - Clear WHEN to spawn multi-agent teams
- **MANDATORY RULES** in ios-development.md - Zero tolerance for violations

### Changed
- 51% documentation reduction (15,476 â†’ ~7,500 lines)
- Clear enforcement hierarchy (MUST vs SHOULD vs OPTIONAL)

### Removed
- 4 redundant files totaling 2,892 lines:
  - GETTING_STARTED.md (428 lines)
  - PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (449 lines)
  - WORKFLOW-IMPROVEMENTS-SUMMARY.md (622 lines)
  - WORKFLOW-ENFORCEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md (1,393 lines)

### Fixed
- README.md simplified from 680 to 380 lines (44% reduction)
- All broken links to deleted files updated

### Why v3.0
Agents were missing critical instructions (team spawning, iOS guidelines) because they were buried in 15K+ lines of documentation. v3.0 puts mandatory requirements front and center with clear enforcement, making it impossible for agents to miss critical instructions.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-20

### Added
- **Phase Gates**: Mandatory analyze + refactor + analyze (performance) at every phase end
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Formal decision documentation workflow
  - ADR template (docs/adr/template.md)
  - ADR guide (docs/adr/README.md)
- **Technical Debt Monitoring**: Phase-by-phase tracking with trend analysis
  - Technical debt log template (tracking/technical-debt-log.md)
- **Performance Baselines**: Platform-specific metrics and regression detection
  - Performance baseline template (tracking/performance-baseline.md)
- **Tool Chaining Patterns**: 7 documented sequences for common scenarios
  - docs/tool-chaining-patterns.md (730 lines)
- **Knowledge Base System**: Structured preservation with continuation IDs
  - tracking/knowledge-base/ directory structure
- **Cross-Phase Retrospectives**: Systematic learning and improvement
  - Retrospective template (tracking/knowledge-base/retrospectives/template.md)

### Why v2.0
Shift from reactive to proactive development workflow. Instead of using tools only when problems occur, v2.0 introduces systematic quality checks at phase boundaries, formal decision documentation, and continuous monitoring to prevent issues before they happen. Expected to reduce bugs reaching later phases by 50-70%.
